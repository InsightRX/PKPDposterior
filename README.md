# PKPDposterior

## Introduction

This software package provides convenience functions around Stan (CmdStanR), Torsten, and
PKPDsim. The goal of the package is to make it easier to full-Bayesian inference
in the context of model-informed precision dosing.

The software is intended for use in education and research, and is **not
intended for clinical use**. By design, this package does not include
functionality that directly provides dosing advice.

## Installation and getting started

Install the latest version of PKPDposterior using remotes or devtools:

``` r
remotes::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDposterior")
devtools::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDposterior")
```

PKPDposterior depends on Torsten and Stan. If you don't already have these
software working, follow the instructions for installing
[Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten). Then, add the file
path to your Stan installation location to your environment variables.

```r
Sys.setenv(STAN_PATH = "path/to/stan")
```

To avoid running the above command every time you restart your R session,
consider adding this environment variable to your .Rprofile or other
configuration file.

Prepare your R session to use Stan by running the following line of code:

```r
cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path(
    path = file.path(Sys.getenv("STAN_PATH"), "cmdstan")
)
```

Great! Now you should be all ready to start modeling!
