## Introduction

This software package provides convenience functions around Stan, Torsten, and
PKPDsim. The goal of the package is to make it easier to full-Bayesian inference
in the context of model-informed precision dosing.

The software is intended for use in education and research, and is **not
intended for clinical use**. By design, this package does not include
functionality that directly provides dosing advice.

## Installation and getting started

Install the latest version of PKPDposterior using remotes or devtools:

``` r
remotes::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDposterior")
devtools::install_github("InsightRX/PKPDposterior")
```

PKPDposterior depends on Torsten and Stan. If you don't already have these 
software working, follow the instructions for installing 
[Torsten](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/Torsten). Then, add the file
path to your Stan installation location to your environment variables.

```r
Sys.setenv(STAN_PATH = "path/to/stan")
```

To avoid running the above command every time you restart your R session, 
consider adding this environment variable to your .Rprofile or other 
configuration file.

Prepare your R session to use Stan by running the following line of code:

```r
cmdstanr::set_cmdstan_path(
    path = file.path(Sys.getenv("STAN_PATH"), "cmdstan")
)
```

Great! Now you should be all ready to start modeling!

## Model syntax

For structured analysis in PKPDposterior it is required to write your
Stan/Torsten models using standardized syntax. The following variables are
recognized, with their approximate equivalent in NONMEM, if available:

| Variable name | Meaning | NONMEM equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dv` | Vector of observed values | `DV` column in input |
| `ipred` | Vector of predicted values for all event times | `IPRED` column in output |
| `ipred_obs` | Vector of predicted values for observation records only | `IPRED` column in output for records where `EVID==0` |
| `ipred_ruv` | Vector of predicted values for observation records only, with residual variability simulated | `Y` in model file, `DV` in output table |
| `n_t` | Number of event records | Number of rows in input dataset |
| `n_cmt` | Number of compartments | |
| `n_obs` | Number of observations | Number of rows in input dataset with `EVID==0` | 
| `i_obs` | Index of observation records within all event records | |
| `theta` | Vector of model parameters | `$THETA` (although not same data format) |
| `ode` | Function for the ODE system | `$ODE` |
| `A` | Vector of amounts in compartments | `A` in model file |
| `dAdt` | Vector of gradients for ODE system | `DADT` in model file |
| `prior_<parameter>` | Samples of prior parameter distribution | |

For models with more than one observation type, such as PK-PD models, or a
parent-metabolite model, the variables related to observations (i.e. in the
first 8 rows) should be appended with a tag for the respective observation type,
e.g. `dv_pk` and `dv_pd`, or `dv_parent` and `dv_metab`, etc. See the
neutropenia model for an example.
